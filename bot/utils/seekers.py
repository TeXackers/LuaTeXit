    Find a guild role given a partial matching string,
    allowing custom role collections and several behavioural switches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    userstr: str
        String obtained from a user, expected to partially match a role in the collection.
        The string will be tested against both the id and the name of the role.
    create: bool
        Whether to offer to create the role if it does not exist.
        The bot will only offer to create the role if it has the `manage_channels` permission.
    interactive: bool
        Whether to offer the user a list of roles to choose from,
        or pick the first matching role.
    collection: List[Union[discord.Role, discord.Object]]
        Collection of roles to search amongst.
        If none, uses the guild role list.
    allow_notfound: bool
        Whether to return `None` when there are no matches, instead of raising `SafeCancellation`.
        Overriden by `create`, if it is set.

    Returns
    -------
    discord.Role:
        If a valid role is found.
    None:
        If no valid role has been found.

    Raises
    ------
    cmdClient.lib.UserCancelled:
        If the user cancels interactive role selection.
    cmdClient.lib.ResponseTimedOut:
        If the user fails to respond to interactive role selection within `60` seconds`
    cmdClient.lib.SafeCancellation:
        If `allow_notfound` is `False`, and the search returned no matches.
